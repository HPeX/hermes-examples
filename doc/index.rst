Thank you for your interest in Hermes!

This document is organized as follows: 

* Section 1 shows how Hermes performs on numerous benchmarks (examples with known exact solutions). 
  Many of them come from the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). Benchmarks 
  like this are great for assessing the performance of a finite element code.
* Section 2 presents examples from various application areas such as acoustics, fluid and solid
  mechanics, electromagnetics, neutronics, quantum chemistry, ground-water flow, and others. 

This document is under continuous development. If you find bugs, typos, dead links 
and such, please report them to the 
`Hermes2D mailing list <http://groups.google.com/group/hermes2d/>`_.

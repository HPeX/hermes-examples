Due to the triviality of the 1D setting, we use Hermes2D to solve 
1D problems. A 1D mesh needs to be replaced with a 2D mesh 
containing just one line of rectangular elements. The size 
of the mesh in the y-direction needs to be 1.0. The examples 
in this section should illustrate everything sufficiently. 

BASIC RULES:

(1) Use the parameter '2' when calling Mesh::refine_all_elements().
    This will refine elements in the x-direction only.
(2) For the reference solution, only refine in the x-direction
    (both in h and p).
(3) Always use ANISO mode in adaptivity, because no refinements
    are needed in the y-direction.

WHERE TO START:

It is recommended to start with example poisson (analogy to the
2D tutorial example P01-linear/03-poisson). 

TODO:

(1) Write a 1D mesh reader that will convert the 1D mesh into 
    a 2D mesh implicitly.
(2) Visualization of solutions, meshes and polynomial orders
    should be redone for 1D solutions.
